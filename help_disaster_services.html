			<p><strong>We combat natural disasters with acts of God.</strong></p>
			<p>While every disaster is unique and creates its own special needs, the core of The Salvation Army's disaster program consists of several basic services. And while these services address many of the typical needs of a disaster survivor, Salvation Army disaster relief is also flexible. Our services are adapted to the specific needs of individuals and communities and scalable according to the magnitude of the disaster.</p>

		<div class="section-row greyBoxes">
			<div class="greyBoxes-box">
				<h6 class="greyBoxes-title"><i class="icon icon-list"></i> Emergency Preparedness</h6>
				<p>As one of the nation's major emergency relief organizations, The Salvation Army recognizes the critical importance of being prepared for natural and man-made disasters. Therefore, we take steps to ensure our own ability to respond quickly and efficiently to a disaster while also working to educate other disaster professionals and the public at large about how to prepare for and respond to emergency situations.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="greyBoxes-box">
				<h6 class="greyBoxes-title"><i class="icon icon-briefcase"></i> Immediate Emergency Response</h6>
				<p>Emergency response services are activated on short notice according to an agreed-upon notification procedure coordinated with federal, state and local governments. Typically, Salvation Army personnel and resources will congregate at predetermined staging areas, entering the impacted area only once government first-responders have indicated that it is safe and constructive to do so. These immediate response activities include food and hydration services, shelter, cleanup and emergency communication assistance to put victims in touch with their loved ones.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="section-row greyBoxes">
			<div class="greyBoxes-box">
				<h6 class="greyBoxes-title"><i class="icon icon-clock"></i> Long-Term Disaster Recovery</h6>
				<p>Depending on the magnitude of the disaster, The Salvation Army may continue providing immediate response services such as emergency shelter and food service well into the recovery process. Additionally, the Army will often coordinate with local, state and federal entities to develop and execute long-term strategic disaster recovery plans. These activities include restoration and rebuilding initiatives, disaster social services (to address essential living needs, medical expenses or funeral costs), and in-kind donation distribution to disaster victims.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="greyBoxes-box">
				<h6 class="greyBoxes-title"><i class="icon icon-prayer"></i> Spiritual and Emotional Care</h6>
				<p>Throughout the duration and aftermath of a major disaster, The Salvation Army provides spiritual comfort and emotional support upon request to victims and emergency workers coping with the stress of a catastrophe. Salvation Army counselors, who are often ordained as clergy (officers), may simply offer a "ministry of presence," but often people who know about The Salvation Army as representatives of God may ask for prayer or help from the Bible. Disaster relief and recovery services are provided to all in need without discrimination.</p>
